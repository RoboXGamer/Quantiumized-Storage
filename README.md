# Quantimized Storage
A NeoForge storage mod where you can store items, fluids, and energy!

# What I want to do at any point:
- Custom disk registration
  - Other storage mods usually have a hardcoded list of disks you have to use, but this mod allows custom disks to be made and used!
*and more*


# Compatibility
If you want a mod to be compatible built-in, just open an issue up, and I'll see if I can do it!
- [ ] CC: Tweaked
- [X] Built-in KubeJS plugin
